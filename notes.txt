******** 1. Igniting the App ***********

1.Creating Hello world using HTML 
<div id="container">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</div>


2.Hello world from Javascript
    <div id="root">
            
    </div>
    <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World from JavaScript!";
        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);
    </script>


3.Hello world from React

i.Copy the Development cdn's from react official website.
ii.write the React code after the cdn links.

<div id="root">

</div>


const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id:"heading"}, "Hello world from React! ");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);


4.Learn how to create nested structure using react 

// Nested structure/elsements

/* 
    <div id="parent">
        <div id="child">
            <h1 id="heading">I am h1 tag</h1>
        </div>
    </div>
*/

/* 
    ReactElement(Object) => HTML (Browser understands)
*/

code:
const parent = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { id: "child" },
    React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "I am an h1 tag")
  )
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(parent);

- To overcome the problem of the complex code, jsx is introduced.


******** 2. Igniting The App 🚀 *************

=> Igniting the App - Making the code for production ready.
=> How we can prepare our own create-react-app.

=> How we can make our App Fast?
   - can react makes our app fast - no, only for an extend 
   we also need lot of packages that makes our app fast.

1.npm
- it does not stands for node package manager, it manages 
the node packages.
- npm is a standard repository for all the packages.
- npm init - to configure npm in our project.

What is package.json?
- It is a configuration for our npm.
Why do we need?
- npm is used to manage the packages in our project,
package.json will take care of the versions of packages.

What is package-lock.json?
package-lock.json- keeps the exact version of the dependencies
that is installed.
- very useful during production, checks whether the version that 
we have in our development i.e in package.json is same as package-lock.json 


what is a Bundler?
The most important package in our App,
A bundler helps us to bundle the code, minimize the code,
so that it can be shift to production.
ex: webpack(create-react-app),parcel,vite etc...

we are going to use parcel.
- At the end of the day all the bundlers will do the same thing.

How to use parcel in our App?
npm install -D parcel - installing parcel as dev dependency.

- we will do the minification and bundling in development itself
so we install parcel as dev dependency.

parcel is a beast.

node_modules: we will install only few dependencies, but in 
node_modules we will have lot of packages this is because every 
dependency has its own dependencies this is called transitive 
dependencies.

How to start the app:
npx parcel index.html 

Features of parcel🚀 :
- Dev Build 
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement - live reload 
- File Watching Algorithm - written in c++.
- Caching - Faster Builds.
- Image Optimization
- minification 
- Bundling all the files 
- Compressing 
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting 
- Differential Bundling - gives the support for older bowsers 
    - different bundle for diff browsers.
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling - good error, better error suggestions.
- Gives us the chance to test our app in 'HTTPS'.
- Tree Shaking - removes unused code 
- Different Dev and prod bundles.

How to make production ready bundler?
npx parcel index.html - to generate dev build.
npx parcel build index.html - to generate prod build.
- all the minified code will be stored in dist 
folder.
- no need to add dist and .parcel-cache into git .

How to make our App that should be compatable for older browsers?
- browser list 
- we have to configure in package.json 

https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAyIHZlcnNpb25z

"browserlist":[
     "last 30 versions"
]

- till now we have created our own create-react-app.

************ 3. Laying the Foundation ****************

JSX 
React Component
Component Composition
Cross Site Scripting/injection attacks - jsx will sanitize
    {data} - browser won't execute it blindly, jsx will sanitize.

JSX is not React ✅❌

***** 4.Talk is cheap show me the code **********

Props: Just normal arguments to a function

*** Config Driven UI: 
Example by taking swiggy: 
All The UI will be configured by data.
- For example the offers carousal and the UI will be different 
for different locations.
- This will be done by the data that we get from backend.
- Suppose if we want to show red color in background in delhi,
green in mumbai etc, we can do this with the data and this is 
what config driven UI is.

- Map,Filter,reduce.

- As a senior developer we have to discuss 
with the backend developer about the data 
what we need in an API.
- unique id is also important while rendering the 
data.
- index is an anti pattern.

******* 5. Lets get Hooked *****

- we are going to learn react hooks

- Plan for the App 
/* 
Header
    - Logo
    - Nav Links
Body
    - Search
    - RestaurantContainer
        - RestaurantCard
            - Img
            - Name of Res,star Rating,Cuisines,Delivery time etc.
Footer
    - Copyright
    - Links
    - Address
    - Contact

*/

Two types of imports and exports, They are:
1.Named imports, Named exports  - import {useState}, export {useState}
2.Default imports , default exports - import RestaurantCard, export default RestaurantCard

React File Structure:
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html

Feature That we are going to build for learning 
Hooks:

A button which filters restaurants with more that 4 star rating.

Why we use Hooks: To make dynamic data according to 
our requirement and change the ui according to the data.

# React Hooks:
    (Normal JS utility function)
- There are multiple hooks.
- There are 2 very important hooks they are:
    - useState() - Superpowerful State variable in react.
    - useEffect() 

- Whenever a state variable updates/changes, react will re render the component.

- React only good at dom, not in minifying and bundling the code, it 
will be done by bundler(parcel/webpack/vite).

- Reconciliation Algorithm(React Fiber)

***** 6. Lets Explore the World ******

- Monolithic Architecture
- Microservice Architecture 


- How we can make API calls and Fetch the Data using React 
    two ways:

- useEffect() Hook 
- cors error - use cors plugin browser extension for now.


- shimmer UI
- Conditional Rendering - rendering according to the condition 

- Why do we need state variables(useState)
    Lets understand with a feature 


*** 7. Lets Find the Path🚀 ****

- In this top we will learn about routing, how we can create 
different pages,nested routes. 

Routing 
- Client Side Routing 
- Server Side Routing - network call and the page will comes from server.

Dynamic Routing 
 - Different pages for different restaurants


******* 8. Lets Get Classy ********

- we will experiment class based components
- Let us build Team members feature in About Page


******** 9. Optimizing our App *********

- Single Responsibility principle.
- Custom Hooks. - makes the code more reusable, modular and testable
    - useRestaurantMenu.js in customHooks
    use: Fetching Data logic will be there in useRestaurantMenu.js (custom Hook)
         Displaying data will be in RestaurantMenu.js 
         - if we get any errors or if we want to test the logic,
            we can test only useRestaurantMenu.js which makes our work 
            easy. 
        - we can create our own custom hook and put in npm as a package.
            ex: usesession storage custom hook and publish it as a npm package.
            
Hooks: Just a Utility Functions. 

- Different Bundles for Different Functionality

- Lazy Loading
- On Demand Loading
const Grocery = lazy(()=> import("./components/Grocery"));
- this online code make a lot of impact.

https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy



********* 10.Jo diktha hai o bakthi hai **********
Normal CSS 
Sass  
scss 

Recomended for Big Projects/Big Companies: 
- Styled components


***** 11.Data is the new oil ********

- How to manage data in our Application.
- Higher Order Components.

Feature: Some of the Restaurants in our Application are 
being promoted to improve their business, so we will take the 
existing RestaurantCard Component and will add Promoted label to 
that RestaurantCard Component.

Higher order components : Is a function that takes a component and returns 
a component with extra features.

******* 12.Lets build our store *****

- Learn Redux.
- How we can manage data using Redux.

# Redux Toolkit 
    - Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.
    - Build our own store. - utils/appStore.js 
    - Connect our store to our app. - using Provider from react-redux.
    - we will create a Slice(cartSlice).
    - dispatch(action)
    - Selector (Read data using Selector)

# important Note:
- reduxjs/toolkit is used to manage our store.
- react-redux is a bridge between react and reduxtoolkit.
